<<masthead-reveal """
Language Integrated Query (LINQ, pronounced "link") is a Microsoft .NET Framework component that adds native data querying capabilities to .NET languages, although ports exist for [[Java]], [[PHP]], [[Javascript]] and [[ActionScript]].
<br/><br/>
LINQ extends the language by the addition of query expressions, which are akin to SQL statements, and can be used to conveniently extract and process data from arrays, enumerable classes, [[XML]] documents, relational databases, and third-party data sources. Other uses, which utilize query expressions as a general framework for readably composing arbitrary computations, include the construction of event handlers or monadic parsers.
<br/><br/>
LINQ also defines a set of method names (called standard query operators, or standard sequence operators), along with translation rules used by the compiler to translate fluent-style query expressions into expressions using these method names, lambda expressions and anonymous types.
<br/><br/>
Many of the concepts that LINQ has introduced were originally tested in Microsoft's CÏ‰ research project. LINQ was released as a major part of .NET Framework 3.5 on November 19, 2007. [[Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query]]
